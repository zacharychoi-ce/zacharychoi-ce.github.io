      <p>* What is Emotional Intelligence?<br><br>
        EQ stands for emotional quotient, defined as an individual's ability to sense, understand and effectively apply the power of these emotions to facilitate higher levels of collaboration and productivity.
        <br><br>
        * How is it different to IQ?<br><br>
        While IQ is a number to represent the relative intelligence of a person. While a person can be very intelligent/smart, this doesn't necessarily translate to collaboration and productivity, thus success (in different ways)
        <br><br>
        * Why is it important?<br><br>
        It helps with these things: successful leaders and superior performers have well developed emotional intelligence skills, as high EQ enables them to work well with a wide variety of people and to respond effectively to the rapidly changing conditions in the business world. In fact, a person's emotional intelligence may be a better predictor of performance success than intelligence.
