      <p>Identify, Values and Strenghts</p><br><br>
      
      <p>      
      1. Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.<br>
      I am empathetic, observant, prospecting and act a lot based on feeling. From this I feel like my values are towards 'people', and how I am able to satisfy the people around me and myself.
      <br><br>
      * Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.<br>
      When I was a shift-manager for a fast food restaurant, you have to manage and build relationships with a lot of staff.. mostly teenagers who are mostly immature in social relationships espeically when it comes to coworkers. There might be a staff who might disrupt the atmosphere of the workplace due to their personality. It is always hard to include these types of staff or to utilise them efficiently in the workplace. Some managers choose to give them less responsiblity or ask the boss to give them less time.. but strangely I've felt sympathy for the person after listening to their background. So I've trained him personally on overnight shifts - later after I quit, I heard that he made it to shift management position while also doing his study.
      <br><br>
      * Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.<br>
      My culture (unlike NZ) is more focused on the community, not the individual. But my upbringing was more invovled with church - therefore serving others. Later growing up with these values, I went through trial and error in terms of my approach to others, as self-sacrificing is always not healthy and at one point I've felt empathy was a weakness. But now that I've found the balance
      <br><br><br>

      2. Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
      <br><br>
      * Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development<br>
      Specific to this course, growing up as a 90's kid and a game-loving kid, I am familiar with getting used to new softwares. (Not so much hardware i.e. knwoledge in computer parts, upgrades etc). <br>
      My limitation would be the lack of patience when it comes to repeated tasks in my previous job. Perhaps it might have been how I untrustworthy I was to the software I was using. Doing my job as a consultant, rather than suggesting a better workaround / additional modification for better processes, I would only stop after fixing the problem. This looked good on my timesheet however I was not growing.
      <br><br>
      * Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.<br>
      The knowledge or the approach that I have with most problem-solving will help me a lot. This strength was developed through my experience as a consultant - so I believe I was not always used to problem-solving. Thus if there are anything that I need to change or develop, I am confident I can be flexible enough to change my process to be a better problem-solver.
      <br><br>
      * Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.<br>
      One of the struggles that I've had during University project work was, the lack of contribution of team members. <br>
      I have done several projects and I had different approaches in some of them. When no one was contributing I have done most of the work. Of course I have informed the lecturer about the contribution so that it would be fair - however it was not healthy for my time management and mentality. <br>
      Another project I would schedule / divide workload with percentages and gave each other different tasks - this worked best and proved to be useful. Thus giving everyone a goal / expectation to meet worked well.
