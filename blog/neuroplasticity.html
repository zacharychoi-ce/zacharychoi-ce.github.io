      <h3>Research Neuroplasticity </h3> 
        <p><br>
        * Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people<br><br>
        Neuroplasticity is an ability that the brain needs to keep on growing, and change. It is vital when our brain needs to learn something - not just in school but also at work and in our daily lives. It is done by repeatedly do or practice something that we want to improve and learn, the the brain's neural networks go through chemical changes therefore we are faster and find it easy to learn the specific task.<br>
        <br><br>
        * Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit<br><br>
        As explained above, repeating the activity will amke this work. Also, knowing this about the brain ourselves also effects our brain to learn more faster - the fact that intellignece is malleable. We are less prone to giving up.<br>
        <br><br>
        * What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity<br><br>
        One would be practicing constantly - repeating an activity or reviewing what we want to learn - this builds thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.<br>
        Another is putting information in context. As explained above, recognising how brains work when learning something.

      <h3>Research Growth Mindset </h3> 
        <p><br>
          * Discuss what it is and why it is relevant<br><br>
          It is the ability to know that one's abilities can be developed. For example, when one is faced with a challenge with a level a bit higher than their current level, they would see this with a mindset of, "I love a challenge", rather than feeling tragic and catstrophic. This is very important in our mindset when we are faced with challenges not just in work but in life as well. Rather than giving up, we know that we can grow and thus giving up is not the immediate response. We engage, and our brains get to work.<br><br>
          
          * In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?<br><br>
          It is surprising how my past experiences, lifestyle and study/work habits build our character. What I mean is, when I am normally faced with a challenge, I 'used' to have the mindset of, even though this may be very frustrating to do I can still learn to do it. However my last 4~5 years of work required me to work on a very short time-fram, I got into a habit of 'giving up', with the excuse of making the most of my time for best efficiency. I was giving results, but I was not growing.
          <br><br>
          * How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?<br><br>
          I already experienced this in Sprint 3, especially from Functions. A lot of logic and structures which started to look similar and without much practice I was failing and I started to get the mindset of 'giving up'. Luckily the motivation to keep on study was 1. my personal deadline 2. commitment (or the reasons) I have made for this course. Since I have now studied growth mindset, I feel I will be able to concentrate and get back on course faster if I ever feel stuck or feel like giving up.

          This is the transcript page of the Ted talk linked from the course handbook. Sometimes videos make it easy for my brain to understand an article fully. But this time, reading the transcript as well as listening to the Ted talk video helped a lot.

      <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies </h3> 
        <p><br>
        
* Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.<br><br>
I think my learning strategy is still the same (in terms of time management etc), but the mindset definitely changed. It is indeed important to have a planned out schedule when studying, but sometimes it is hard to keep the schedule when I am not mentally prepared. But I now know what to remind myself of (growth mindset, fixed vs growth) whenever I feel lack of motivation.
