      <h3>Facing a problem and how I solved it</h3> 
        <p><br>
        * The problem that I've faced.<br><br>
        When writing coding for a particular function that I wanted to create, I faced the issue where I knew what I wanted to achieve, but did not have the experience to write the code<br>
        <br>
        * What problem solving techniques did you use?<br><br>
        First I wrote down what I wanted to do, and broke the sentences down into different steps. Then, at first I wrote the code, ran it to see what the error was, fixed the code, repeat and repeat. After realising I was missing something in my coding, I then turned to Google to look for sample/similar coding.
        
        <br><br>
        * How did you feel throughout the process?<br><br>
        Normally, problem solving is something I enjoy however in this particular example of problem solving, I felt very chased by my own deadline that I've set up. This led me very anxious in the process and each failed attempt started to give me stress.
        <br><br>
        * What did you learn?<br><br>
        Then I took a break and took a walk, even went out for grocery shopping and the anxiety that I was feeling was gone. Then I cleared my head, got myself back into my chair and started to look things over from the start with calmness. Using one of the techniques that I've learnt - not just Googling but doing the Rubber Ducky method in my head (not the actual rubber duck unfortunately) and looking at threads on Slack, the fix for the code rather came quickly in my head. Then I've realised that every attempt at fixing the code I was actually making progress, but I didn't notice this progress as I felt I was rushing.
        <br><br>
        </p>
      
      <h3>Problem Solving Techniques - how confident am I?</h3> 
        <p><br>
          * Pseudocode<br><br>
          Commenting each line.. I personally don't find them useful at the moment, as the comment lines are greyed out - but I think I have been 'commenting' in my head - the rubber ducky method.<br><br>
          
          * Rubber ducky method<br><br>
          Surprisingly, this method worked the couple of times I've used it. Even though I did it in my head (e.g. in order to achieve this function, I need to first set the variable up, and then do this..).

          <br><br>
          * Reading error messages<br><br>
          The actual error messages helped me understand the 'error' in my coding, such as a missing comma or a semicolon. Knowing the difference of these error messages compared to others helped me realise if my coding as a whole was an issue, or if I simply made a typo / missing something in a particular line.
          <br><br>
          * Console.logging<br><br>
          I actually did not use this much personally as most of my practice was done in Repl so far, as the test code already has something there to tell me what the issue with my coding is etc. I will use this in the future for my own coding outside Repl.
          <br><br>
          * Googling<br><br>
          This came in handy.. to see how a function etc should look as a whole before I write the actual code - mainly because I am not yet 100% familiar with how coding for functions etc should look like.
          <br><br>
          * Asking your peers for help<br><br>
          I am not too confident with this method as I only had one interaction with a peer for help - as most of my questions were already asked on Slack and other peers' answers gave me enough directions so far.
          <br><br>* Asking coaches for help<br><br>
          Haven't had the chance to, but we shall see this week!
          <br><br>
          * Improving your process with reflection<br><br>
          I think this follows naturally after every exercise that I do. Especially when it takes too long to complete, I go over my codes and see what took the longest, and that lets me know where to improve.
