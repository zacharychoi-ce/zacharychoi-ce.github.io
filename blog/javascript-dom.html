        * An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS
        <br>
        <br>
        HTML and CSS are used for building websites. <strong>HTML</strong> can be seen like a body or a skeleton, a must-have blueprint at first. Then <strong>CSS</strong> is like the muscles which make up how the HTML will look like, but will need a body, the HTML to build on.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones). 
        <br>
        <br>
        A <strong>Control Flow</strong> is like a task-list to do, but it must be run in order. If you put a task in the first line, then this line needs to be done first before the next task.
        <br>Then you have <strong>Loops</strong>, which makes the code does something over and over again until it meets a condition, then it will either finish or move onto the next task. An example of a loop would be, you task yourself to do 20 push-ups. Everytime you do one push up, you minus one from the count. 20, 19, 18, 17 ... 3, 2, 1, 0. Once you reach 0, you stop the push-up and have a drink of water.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        DOM is short for Document Object Model. By definition, it is an application programming interface - which defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. In other words, this helps you see how a webpage document is structured, like a tree-diagram.This is used for webpages on a browser. <br>
        Also, it is a utility to let you know made changes to the things currently showing on the webpage. Or you can use this tool to look closely into the elements of the webpage - such as an interactive picture - you can use the DOM to make changes to this to change how it appears, or see how it is working.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        <br>
        Arrays in Javascript language is like a 'list', or a 'collection'. It is used to store multiple values.
        In programming language, there are different types of data - such as text (which is called Strings), and numbers, or True/False. An Array can store all of these data.
        <br>
        On the other hand, an Object repesents one thing as a whole and its properties. An example is a person - their name, age, height, hair colour etc etc. These characteristics are called 'properties' in programming language, and has a value with their own specific data type.
        <br>
        <br>
        * Explain what functions are and why they are useful.
        <br>
        <br>
        As the name implies, simply put a Function is used to perform a task. It is supposed to result in something, or in programming language, 'returning a value'. 
        <br> One important reason of using a function is that we can write a function but use them later, also repeatedly. This therefore saves a lot of coding time as we don't need to write tasks over and over again.
        <br>There are many uses of functions - from simply displaying a result of something, to helping us edit and debug the webpage that we are trying to manipulate.
