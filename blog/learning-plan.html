       Reassessing my learning plan, Sprint 5 cultural blog
       <br><br>* What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
       <br><br>I don't have a destination in mind, because I came into the course thinking that I could somehow utilise 'hard-code' skills to improve my job in IT consulting, like a business analyst. However going through the foundations I realised the skills that I learn are very different to what I had in mind. On the other hand, it opened my eyes to a lot of new opportunities. I think I feel excitement, like going on an adventure.
       <br><br>* What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?<br><br>
       One of my strengths will be working with others.. however my weakness is also apparent in the same area - when I feel I am stuck or feel behind, I go quiet and feel reluctant to keep going, and feel sorry for others. I guess this is a bad habit of being too harsh on myself. I need to not forget that I am here to learn, and learning is my job right now.
       <br><br>* What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?<br><br>
       This relates to the above question. If I start that I am being a burden to someone I can't stop being harsh on myself. However I know that we are learning human skills(core skills), I hope this subject is dealt with so I can learn how to improve.
       <br><br>* What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?<br><br>
       Even though I feel I go along well with people, I sometimes feel working with others uncomfortable. I tend to work better when working alone. When the minds don't align, more explanation is required between people which consumes more energy. However talking to Lache and looking at the listening and looping exercise, this is encouraged/pushed so I am preparing my mind for this.
       <br><br>* What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
       <br><br>Accessibility - I'm sure everyone will be there to help, but I tend to be stuck on my own for a long time and if facilitators are occupied I don't think I want to disturb their train of thoughts.
       <br><br>* What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
       <br><br>I have a friend who has done this course before - he explained about the meaning of 'bootcamp' - the bootcamp normally is a word for an army training camp, etc. If I think of this course as a bootcamp, my mindset will be in the right place.. hopefully. Also with the expectation of 50~60 hours a week to commit every week, I know that I will be studying in the weekends. So my plan is to go through a week, write down and make a plan for review/study and keep to the plan. Not to get demotivated, I will keep reminding myself that this is a bootcamp and doesn't last for a whole year but only a short while - I need to make the most of this.

      <p>Formulating my learning plan<br><br>
      
      * What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?<br><br>
      A developer that knows both the technical and business side of things. I believe my vision is only as wide as my experiences - thus currently a technical BA would be one of the goals I have in mind currently.
      <br><br>
      * A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning<br><br>
      My strengths would be my flexibility in adjusting and learning new skills/environments. However my weakness/limitation would be, when I am mentally overwhelmed with tight schedule/workload, it is hard for me to set aside a time to look into the source of the problem - thus focusing only on the fix. This would get the job done, but I won't be making much improvements.
      <br><br>
      * What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?<br><br>
      We are of course focusing on Javascript, HTML, CSS, but on top of this I would like to understand the core of development, so I can always put myself into a new language environment and learn the language with ease.
      <br>
      (Updated 29/04/2021) Non-technical, human skills - my type of workstyle is more focused on human emotions which eventually effects the direction of the work, I would like to gain a firm stance when engaging work. In a way, more confidence is what I want. This is to stop myself from sacrificing too much (doing too much work while it may be unnecessary etc), thus finding the balance between mental health and work. One way I can think of to achieve this, is a complete confidence in myself in terms of work skills/ethics..

      <br><br>
      * A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>
      - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
      As explained in the course handbook, (and using Toggl), setting up and assigning times for each day will be wise. Time for my persoanl work/development, time to meet with facilitators/colleagues/representatives etc. If majority of my times are spent doing work other than my personal work/preparation, I would do okay for a bit at first but later will not be able to catchup / develop.
      <br><br>
 
      - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br><br>
      I normally tell myself: don't panic when it is time to panic. Make a list of what I should do, (and if possible cancel/delay unimportant appointments/tasks). Prioritise. I've found myself doing the easy tasks all at first gave me peace of mind and efficiency.

      <br><br>
      * A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br><br>
      Normally if it comes to seeking help, I usually want to have proof to show I have done my homework/research but still need help - not for the people helping me but for myself as well, to improve. Thus setting aside a time prior to asking help for research, then scheduling a time with the facilitator.

      <br><br>
      * A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br><br>
      After finishing the Sprint 2 tech blog, I feel there are some things that can be overlooked - e.g. some styling methods are easier to use than others but would look too simple on display. Perhaps suggestions to better / different methods that I may have missed / not know?



      <br><br>
      * Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.<br><br>
      For me it will be Sundays and sometimes Thursdays for church service/meetings.
