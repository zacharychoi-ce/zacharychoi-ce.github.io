      <p>Formulating my learning plan<br><br>
      
      * What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?<br><br>
      A developer that knows both the technical and business side of things. I believe my vision is only as wide as my experiences - thus currently a technical BA would be one of the goals I have in mind currently.
      <br><br>
      * A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning<br><br>
      My strengths would be my flexibility in adjusting and learning new skills/environments. However my weakness/limitation would be, when I am mentally overwhelmed with tight schedule/workload, it is hard for me to set aside a time to look into the source of the problem - thus focusing only on the fix. This would get the job done, but I won't be making much improvements.
      <br><br>
      * What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?<br><br>
      We are of course focusing on Javascript, HTML, CSS, but on top of this I would like to understand the core of development, so I can always put myself into a new language environment and learn the language with ease.
      <br>
      (Updated 29/04/2021) Non-technical, human skills - my type of workstyle is more focused on human emotions which eventually effects the direction of the work, I would like to gain a firm stance when engaging work. In a way, more confidence is what I want. This is to stop myself from sacrificing too much (doing too much work while it may be unnecessary etc), thus finding the balance between mental health and work. One way I can think of to achieve this, is a complete confidence in myself in terms of work skills/ethics..

      <br><br>
      * A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:<br>
      - An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives<br>
      As explained in the course handbook, (and using Toggl), setting up and assigning times for each day will be wise. Time for my persoanl work/development, time to meet with facilitators/colleagues/representatives etc. If majority of my times are spent doing work other than my personal work/preparation, I would do okay for a bit at first but later will not be able to catchup / develop.
      <br><br>
 
      - What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you<br><br>
      I normally tell myself: don't panic when it is time to panic. Make a list of what I should do, (and if possible cancel/delay unimportant appointments/tasks). Prioritise. I've found myself doing the easy tasks all at first gave me peace of mind and efficiency.

      <br><br>
      * A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way<br><br>
      Normally if it comes to seeking help, I usually want to have proof to show I have done my homework/research but still need help - not for the people helping me but for myself as well, to improve. Thus setting aside a time prior to asking help for research, then scheduling a time with the facilitator.

      <br><br>
      * A description of what you expect from the facilitation team<br><br>
      After finishing the Sprint 2 tech blog, I feel there are some things that can be overlooked - e.g. some styling methods are easier to use than others but would look too simple on display. Perhaps suggestions to better / different methods that I may have missed / not know?



      <br><br>
      * Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.<br><br>
      For me it will be Sundays and sometimes Thursdays for church service/meetings.
