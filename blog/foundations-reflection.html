      <p>Foundation reflections</p><br><br>

      1. What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
      <br><br>
      The question mentions 'ego', which I've felt a lot during the foundation course. My ego comes into play when I get stuck during an exercise - I could not accept myself for not being able to solve the problems. Also this is something I knew already still had a problem with.. time management. With the result of being disappointed in myself, I could not put myself in a long session of studying. However the last thing I've felt about myself is my ability to recover - some personal things happened along with bad time management. I felt like giving up multiple times but was able to focus on continuing with the course.<br>
      <br><br>
      2. What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
      <br><br>
      Although we are learning how to code, we are human to begin with. I feel having the mentality to know myself - on how I react to new things or learning are very important, and also having the correct values in the attitude towards learning will help immensenly in focusing and also in motivation.
      <br><br>
      3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      <br><br>
      Mostly surprised at how maintaining our 'mind' is very important. This first started in utilising the Calm app - this was early in the foundation so did not pay attention to it at first, but when the exercises started to get harder, using Calm to meditate and reflect on myself helped me get back to track despite some uncomfortable situations
      <br><br>
      4. What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      <br><br>
      The interactions that we were tasked to do - listening and looping. It was challening as I personally am very reluctant to go into awkward situations (even though when I am committed to the situation I become okay and can mingle well etc). However there was indeed a purpose for the listening and looping - I have learnt a lot about myself when listening, how I react to other people's words and thoughts. It was a pleasant experience.
      <br><br>
      5. Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
      <br><br>
      I don't want to sound stereotypical, but having my own friends who are programmers - some are definitely not social and very awkward in dealing with uncomfortable situations with people. Not just with strangers, but with meeting clients etc. Also I can see how that can translate to less effectiveness in a team environment. I did not think much about why this school focused so much on human-related skills (core skills), but now I understand how the school is preparing us to work effectively in a team and also directing our minds to be a better person, fundamentally.
      <br><br>
      6. Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.
      <br><br>
      In all honesty, I did feel studying for core would be a time to 'ease-off' from the techinical learning which would be a good balance - so I thought of it as a time to relax and.. 'slack-off'. But I learnt this helped organise my mind better.. not sure how to word this in a better way. First time learning things like this in an institute (core, human skills), but am thankful for this opportunity. Wish I had this opportunity when I was a teenager.
